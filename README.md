# What is RoboCat?

RoboCat is an autonomous quadruped robot designed to patrol public streets and monitor parking zones that are regulated by payment. Its structure and external appearance is inspired by the shape of a cat, making it not only functional but also friendly and approachable for pedestrians.
Equipped with sensors, cameras and onboard computing, RoboCat can detect whether a parked vehicle has an active parking permit or not, combining robotics, computer vision and real-time data processing to offer a smart, mobile solution for urban mobility enforcement.

The project main goals are to:
  - Automate parking control in regulated areas </u>
  - Reduce the need for manual inspection </u>
  - Integrate urban robotics with a friendly and non-threatening design </u>
  - Demonstrate the application of robotics in real-world city environments </u>

# How To Use

To set up and run RoboCat on your system, follow these simple steps:
### Step 1: Download the repository
Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joanmarc28/Robocat.git
```
### Step 2: Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. You can set up the required environment using pip by running requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```
#### How do I install Python?
If you don't have Python installed, download it from the official website:
[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
You can check your Python version by running:
```bash
python --version
```
### Step 3: Run the system
Once everything is installed, you can run the setup file:
```bash
bash setup_robocat.sh
```
Make sure the robot is powered on and properly connected before executing the .sh file.
